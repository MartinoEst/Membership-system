In home PC, downloaded the files by zip from 
https://github.com/alwong2000/Membership-system
and stored into my PC for modification.
Created scsl.ueuo.com ac for testing:
Created mariadb database & create tables, run some sql scripts
 uploading the modified files php scripts and tested.
Downloaded also filezilla for easier ftp but showed disk full (may be buffer full due to ftp quota)
